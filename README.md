# etherscan test automation

This repository contains UI tests for https://etherscan.io

## Technologies

* [Typescript] programming language
* [Cypress] testing tool

## Reason behind chosen technologies

So far, I had a chance to work with Java/Selenium and Typescript/Cypress combinations of language/test tool. I've chosen Cypress for this task for couple of reasons:
* It's the more recent framework I've been working with
* It's newer technology
* It's easy to configure 
* It has a lot of options for various types of testing (unfortunately didn't have a chance to demonstrate full potential on the task of this scale)
* It has very good community which makes it easier to utilize it for larger scale applications

For the full automation experience, Cypress can be easily configured for CI/CD thanks to their [fairly intuitive documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/github-actions?utm_source=Binary%3A%20App&utm_medium=CI%20Prompt%201&utm_campaign=GitHub&utm_content=Manual#What-you-ll-learn)
